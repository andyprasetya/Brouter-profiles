#### My profiles for  [BRouter Android application](http://brouter.de/brouter/) 
 
*  This repository serves just as a featured storage for end user profiles and auxiliary files. The template-based profile development is done in dedicated repositories for respective templates. 

* If you are going just derive your own profile from existing ones, you may want to fork this repository.

* **If you are going to contribute to development of the profiles derived from foot/bike/car profile templates by setting particular parameter values in the templates, do NOT fork this repository, but fork the independent respective repositories of the templates under my github account.**

* See [Brouter profiles wiki](https://github.com/poutnikl/Brouter-profiles/wiki) for more detailed general and end user information.

* BRouter is a local offline navigation routing service for Android. It primarily aimes for bicycle routing, but is very vell applicable for foot and car routing as well, even if it cannot beat dedicated car navigations. It serves as back-end routing for Android map/navigation applications LocusMap, OSMAnd and Oruxmaps. Its Java variant serves as a back-end routing for the [Brouter-web](http://brouter.de/brouter-web/) front-end. It is able also to run standalone, providing as the output the route in navigation hints in the form of GPX file.
